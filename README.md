# MangoBall Catastrophe Ball
This repo is an archive of the **Catastrophe ball** game, made by retired youtuber **MangoBall**.
Dedicated to bug fixes and well, just have a good time playing it.

## How did I extract it?
Using the **[TurboWarp Unpackager](https://turbowarp.github.io/unpackager)** I extracted the static files of the precompiled Electron release.
